### Working Through REACTOs

Redoing all REACTOs from Grace Hopper

## Notes

TwoNumSum - Successfully completed brute force and pointers approach unprompted.
MultiplicativePersistence - First instinct was recursive. Worked, but not clean.
BreadthFirst - Tried to complicate it with recursion, but knew that I needed to use a queue. Solution made sense. Second try no issues.
DepthFirst - Was unable to get close to a solution. After revisit, was able to solve immediately.
Stock - + Brute force first try no issues. Optimized worked backwards from solution.
Palindrome - + Brute force came very quickly. Struggled with recursive solution. Still not sure why we need a return statement there.
StringSearch - + Understood problem, could only return last instance of complete needle, not first. Worked backwards from solution after 2 attempts.
PairSum - Basically same as twoNumSum. Implemented with pointers.
arrayThreeSum - + Came close to a solution, but not close enough. Memo solution doesn't make sense.
mergeTwoLinkedLists - UNSOLVED
