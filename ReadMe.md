### Working Through REACTOs

Redoing all REACTOs from Grace Hopper

## Notes

TwoNumSum - Successfully completed brute force and pointers approach unprompted.
MultiplicativePersistence - First instinct was recursive. Worked, but not clean.
BreadthFirst - Tried to complicate it with recursion, but knew that I needed to use a queue. Solution made sense.
DepthFirst - Was unable to get close to a solution.
