### Working Through REACTOs

Redoing all REACTOs from Grace Hopper

## Notes

TwoNumSum - Successfully completed brute force and pointers approach unprompted.
MultiplicativePersistence - First instinct was recursive. Worked, but not clean.
BreadthFirst - Tried to complicate it with recursion, but knew that I needed to use a queue. Solution made sense.
DepthFirst - Was unable to get close to a solution.
Stock - Brute force first try no issues. Optimized worked backwards from solution.
Palindrome - Brute force came very quickly. Struggled with recursive solution. Still not sure why we need a return statement there.
StringSearch - Understood problem, could only return last instance of complete needle, not first. Worked backwards from solution after 2 attempts.
